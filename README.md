## DeepGit

**DeepGit** is an autonomous agent designed to perform deep semantic research across GitHub repositories. It intelligently searches, analyzes, and ranks repositories based on user intent — even for less-known but highly relevant tools.

## ⚙️ How It Works — Agentic Workflow

When a user submits a query, **DeepGit Orchestrator Agent** takes over. Here's the breakdown of the pipeline:

### 🔹 1. Query Expansion Tool
Enhances vague user queries using language models to add specificity and context — enabling more accurate downstream retrieval.

### 🔹 2. Semantic Retrieval Tool
Uses state-of-the-art embedding models to semantically match the enhanced query against a broad set of GitHub repositories.

### 🔹 3. Documentation Intelligence Tool
Summarizes and interprets README files to understand the purpose, setup, and key features of each repository.

### 🔹 4. Codebase Mapping Tool
Analyzes the project’s file structure and technology stack to assess complexity, modularity, and suitability for the user’s needs.

### 🔹 5. Community Insight Tool
Gathers social signals like stars, forks, issues, and pull request activity to gauge real-world engagement and maturity.

### 🔹 6. Relevance Synthesis Tool
Combines insights from all modules to compute a final relevance score tailored to the user query.

### 🔹 7. Insight Delivery Module
Presents ranked repositories to the user with concise summaries and justifications — enabling smart discovery.

## 🚀 Goals

- Surface powerful but under-the-radar open-source tools.
- Build an intelligent layer over GitHub for research-focused developers.
- Open-source the entire workflow to promote transparent research.
